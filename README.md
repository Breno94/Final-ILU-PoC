In this project I'm using Python to scrape information of the IMBD webpage. This project is part of a post-graduation program which I attended from end of 2019 to 2021. The course is ofered by PUC-Rio, which is a well-known renowned University.

For this work I'm using a couple of well-known Python libraries and modules such as Requests, Beautifulsoup and Pandas. I've created a main object that is responsible to scrape all the HTML information of the webpage as well as treat the retreived data. Finally, I use the information in a Pandas DataFrame to run some basic analysis.

Please enjoy and if there're any questions, my contact is on my front page.
